// EULA section 2.1 says the application presents the agreement on first launch
// and does not proceed until it is accepted. `crux_eula` implements that and
// tests itself thoroughly — but a shared widget that nothing mounts is a
// promise the suite is not keeping, and the package's own green suite cannot
// see it. Several Enterprise features have already been found built, tested
// and constructed nowhere; this is the cheap guard that stops the agreement
// becoming the next one.
//
// Three claims, all mechanically checkable against app.dart:
//
//  1. The gate is mounted at all.
//  2. It wraps OUTSIDE `TelemetryConsentGate`. Not a style preference — the
//     telemetry disclosure asks consent for a term the EULA defines (EULA 8),
//     so collecting it first has the user answering a question about a
//     contract they were never shown, and the EEA/UK/CH/KR opt-in default
//     stops being defensible.
//  3. The persistence seam is bound. Unbound, the package falls back to an
//     in-memory store, and the agreement is presented on every single launch.
