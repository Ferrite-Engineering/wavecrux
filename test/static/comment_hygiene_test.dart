// Static guard for the Crux suite's clinical-comment convention. The Pro
// overlay carries its own copy.
//
// A comment must describe the code as it stands, for a reader who has no
// access to the development process that produced it. Four classes of prose
// fail that test and are rejected here:
//
//  1. Backlog / track identifiers used as anchors. A quality-round row id is
//     deleted when the round closes, so a comment anchored to one becomes
//     unreadable. The only documents a comment may cite are ones a reader of
//     this repository can open: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the verification
//     guide, and public specifications. Plan sections, phases and work-stream
//     ids of documents outside the repository are rejected, in comments and
//     everywhere else, by `no_private_references_test.dart`.
//  2. Dates used as process notes. A stamp narrating when work happened
//     carries no information about the code. Dates that are data — licence
//     headers, fixture payloads, format examples — are unaffected.
//  3. Session / process voice. Prose scoped to the sitting that wrote it
//     ("this round", "for now", person-addressed TODOs) expires immediately
//     and cannot be evaluated later.
//  4. Reviewer voice. A comment addressed to someone reading the change,
//     rather than to someone reading the code, is misfiled — that content
//     belongs in the commit message.
//
// Scope: classes 1–4 over `lib/`; class 1 alone over `test/` and
// `integration_test/`, where the identifier-anchor defect has recurred but
// change-narration in a test's own docstring is legitimate.
//
// Only comment text is examined. String literals are skipped by the scanner,
// so identifier-shaped domain data (source-location fragments, state names,
// fixture strings) cannot trigger a finding, and the patterns written below
// do not match themselves.
