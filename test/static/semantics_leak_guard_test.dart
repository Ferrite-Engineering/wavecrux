// Static guard for the mandatory macOS semantics-leak suppressor.
//
// `integration_test/helpers/app_driver.dart` (and the Pro overlay's
// `pro_app_driver.dart`, which re-exports it) states the rule outright:
// "`suppressPlatformSemanticsLeak()` MUST be called in every macOS
// integration test's `main()` right after
// `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`."
//
// It was documented and not enforced, so files drifted off it in both this repo and the Pro overlay. The
// macOS embedder raises "semantics enabled" mid-test when an accessibility
// client attaches; the resulting SemanticsHandle is never disposed and
// `_verifySemanticsHandlesWereDisposed` fails the test at teardown. Whether
// that happens is a property of the MACHINE, not the test — which is why the
// suppressor is applied blanket rather than per-symptom, and why the drift
// went unnoticed: a file without it fails only on a host where a client
// happens to attach, and passes everywhere else.
//
// Scope: every `integration_test/**/*_test.dart` that installs the
// integration binding. Files that do not install it never launch the real
// app, so no embedder signal can reach them — see the exemption below.
