/// distributed outside the Mac App Store, and they shell out to external tools
/// and bind local sockets. `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` must stay `false`;
/// flipping it on re-breaks file access, subprocess spawning and CXP in one go.
///
/// **`user-selected.read-write` is required even so.** Without it, every picker
/// invocation in a release build fails with
/// `PlatformException(ENTITLEMENT_NOT_FOUND, ...)` — while debug builds keep
/// working, because `DebugProfile.entitlements` carries broader permissions,
/// and opening a file by CLI argument keeps working too. That combination is
/// why the 2026-07-16 marketing-screenshot session was the first thing to
/// catch it: the failure is invisible unless you launch a *release* build from
/// Finder and reach for the picker.
///
/// **The network entitlements are asymmetric, and that is only safe while the
/// sandbox is off.** Every one of these files declares
/// `com.apple.security.network.server` (CXP binds a local socket) and declares
/// no `network.client` at all. Sandbox entitlements are enforced *by* the
/// sandbox, so with it disabled neither line does anything and the asymmetry
/// is inert. Enable the sandbox and it stops being inert in the worst way:
/// CXP keeps working, while the update check and telemetry upload fail
/// silently, because outbound connections are the half with no entitlement.
/// The test below ties those two facts together rather than leaving them in
/// separate assertions that each look fine alone.
///
/// `flutter create` emits none of this — it writes `app-sandbox` as `true` and
/// omits the file-access key entirely — so a future platform-directory
/// regeneration would silently revert it. Hence a static test rather than a
/// code review convention.
