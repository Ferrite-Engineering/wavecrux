/// `tester.runAsync(() => Future.delayed(someFixedDuration))` means "sleep on
/// the real event loop and hope the real async work I did not start finishes
/// inside this window". It fails in the worst possible way. `runAsync`
/// suspends the test body, so while it is running nothing calls `pump()`, so
/// the fake-async zone's microtask queue is never drained. Any future whose
/// completion depends on a continuation queued in that zone — an
/// `AsyncNotifier.build` awaiting file I/O, say — therefore cannot complete
/// inside a later `runAsync`. If the fixed sleep was long enough, the test
/// passes; if it was not, the test does not go red, it **deadlocks**, and
/// nothing bounds it but the default test timeout. That is a ten-minute burn
/// per occurrence at ten-times billing on the macOS runners
/// (`test/flutter_test_config.dart` now caps it at two minutes, which bounds
/// the cost but does not remove the cause).
///
/// The fix is always one of two shapes, never a longer sleep:
///
/// * `runAsync` the real-async **operation itself**, so the awaited future is
///   both created and completed on the real event loop —
///   `await tester.runAsync(() => notifier.openTab(...))`, as
///   `workspace_screen_test.dart` and `simcrux_action_handlers_test.dart` do.
/// * Or remove the real event loop from the test: fake the I/O seam so every
///   future is microtask-bound and a plain `pumpAndSettle()` is exact, as
///   `cli_regression_bootstrapper_test.dart` does — the case where the widget
///   under test starts the async work itself, leaving nothing for the test to
///   wrap.
///
/// A third shape is permitted and not flagged: a **bounded poll loop** that
/// alternates a short `runAsync` slice with a `pump()` and exits on a counter
/// or a condition. That is the honest form of "I cannot wrap this operation" —
/// it drains the fake-async zone between slices and terminates on its own
/// bound rather than on the test timeout. See [_insideBoundedLoop].
///
/// MUTATION: adding `await tester.runAsync(() => Future.delayed(const
/// Duration(milliseconds: 50)));` to any test file makes this guard red.
